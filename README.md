# Algo-DataStructures
This folder will be showing some programming exercises made by me using Python Language.
```
1) Create an algorithm which can get braces balanced, the opening and closing ones evenly right. 
```
[balanced_parentheses] (https://github.com/GustaEnge/Algo-DataStructures/blob/master/balanced_parentheses.py)
```
2) Read 2 real number sets , storing them in lists and computing the scalar product between them. Let 5 elements into each list, print both of 2 sets and their scalar product, knowing this operation is given by x1 ∗ y1 + x2 ∗ y2 + ... + xn ∗ yn
```
[scalar_product] (https://github.com/GustaEnge/Algo-DataStructures/blob/master/scalar_product.py)

```
3) Let 10 whole numbers be stored into a list. After, define which ones are prime numbers and their positions. 
```
[prime_numbers] (https://github.com/GustaEnge/Algo-DataStructures/blob/master/prime_numbers.py)
```
4) Read 2 whole number lists  x and y, each one with 5 elements (Assuring that there won't be repetitive numbers). Compute it and show the outcome lists following rules (Set Operations) below:
• Add between x and y: add each element in x to each one in y.
• Product between x and y: multiplication operation from each element in x to each element in y.
• Difference between x and y: all elements in x that don't belong to y.
• Intersection between x and y: only the elements that belong to both sets (w and y).
• Union between x and y: all elements in x and all those ones that don't belong to y set

```
